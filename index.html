			Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and ty<br >pesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, <br >when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. 
	<br >
	It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. 
	<br >
	It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
